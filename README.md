The model is structured around 6 unique classifiers. Each classifier is dedicated to a specific feature, making for a total of 36 neurons. This architecture allows for fine-grained sentiment analysis and captures nuances that traditional models might miss.

ðŸŽ¯ Results
Our model achieved a commendable score of 0.73! To put that into perspective, the winning model's score was just a nudge higher at 0.75. We're pretty proud of how close we came to the top spot!

âš¡ Fun Fact
Did you know? The human brain consists of approximately 86 billion neurons! Our model might have 36, but we're catching up! ðŸ˜‰
